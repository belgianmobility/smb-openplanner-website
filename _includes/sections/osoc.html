        <p>The proof of the pudding is in the eating. We will put our open source tools for data integration to the test
          during Open Summer of Code. 10 students will develop 3 concrete suggestions from the open call for ideas!</p>

          <h5> <span>01.</span> Configurator for individual route planners</h5>
          <p>
            Would you prefer to avoid mud? Do you dislike left turns? Do you wish to go downhill? This configurator will
            be
            created for anyone who is interested in configuring their very own route planner to answer your personal
            mobility needs. We will demonstrate our configurator using the velomobile as a test case .

          <h5><span>02.</span>Mobility scores dataset generator</h5>
          <p>
            Imagine real estate agents being able to better identify the value of a property by the score of its
            location
            and accessibility. Imagine two people being able to have a meeting at their most reachable mid-point. The
            mobility scores dataset generator allows developers to create a dating app, a real estate mobility app, a
            meeting planner, etc. using the mobility scores we provide.

          <p>
            With an e-bike, it is easy to cover greater distances. This application will provide an intermodal route
            planner
            that demonstrates cyclists all different mobility options to use their e-bike in the best way.
